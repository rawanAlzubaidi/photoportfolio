                    <p>My love for photography came from my sister, Haya. The camera is hers, and I somewhat 'borrowed' it permanently when she got married. She purchased it back in 2013â€”a year that might seem recent, but it was actually 11 years ago. It has captured special moments in my life: weddings, my own and my friends' graduations, birthdays, impromptu fashion shows with my friends in middle school, and many vacations, with Spain being the last. I thought I could start sharing some of my favorite moments that I have captured, starting with last year.
For my graduation, my friends gifted me a film camera, so I am excited to start exploring with different cameras and share them on here.</p>
